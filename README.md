## my algoexpert.io solutions -- JavaScript
###### Andrew E. Sokolowski

Folder contains my solutions to algoexpert.io practice problems. Because
algoexpert is a paid service, I am not going to copy and paste any goals,
as this is more a backup copy for myself anyway (i.e. if the site suddenly
closes up shop or drops my account). In the test files I'll paraphrase what's
going on if it's not obvious (like Bubble Sort).

Maybe I'll try another language if I get bored with JavaScript (or suddenly
have an upcoming tech interview in C++, Java, or Python) but I like it
for this algorithm stuff because it's close to pseudocode and has braces.

### To run sample tests:
if you don't have Node installed globally, install it

to run a single test, navigate to the desired folder and enter 'node attempt'
to run all the tests, you'd probably want to create a file, so from the root
of this project enter 'node index > results.txt && code results.txt'. Obviously
code can be replaced with vi or whatever program you wish to view the results
in
